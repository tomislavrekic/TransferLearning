# TransferLearning
Uses a MobileNetV2 model as a foundation for image classification

Model was trained via Transfer Learning. Its foundation is the convolutional part of the MobileNetV2 model. The classifier part of the neural network was trained from scratch to recognize 51 classes of animals.

The trained model is then used in [this](https://github.com/tomislavrekic/TensorFlowTest) application to classify pictures of animals.
